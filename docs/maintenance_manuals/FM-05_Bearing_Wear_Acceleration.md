# Maintenance Manual — FM-05: Bearing Wear Acceleration

## Safety Precautions
- Ensure full shutdown and lockout before disassembly.
- Handle bearings carefully to avoid contamination.

## Tools & Equipment
- Bearing puller and installation tools
- Micrometer and bore gauge
- Lubricant and lubricant-cleaning equipment
- Magnification inspection tools

## Estimated Time
- Inspection and lubrication: 1–2 hours
- Bearing replacement: 3–6 hours

## Steps
1. Verify shutdown and apply lockout/tagout.
2. Inspect lubricant condition; take a lubricant sample for analysis.
3. If lubricant degradation present, perform full lubricant refresh and system flush.
4. Remove bearing assembly and inspect surfaces with magnification for scoring or wear.
5. Replace bearings per manufacturer torque and tolerance specs if wear exceeds limits.
6. Reassemble and perform friction calibration cycle.

## Verification
- `sensor_5` values return above -0.75 friction index and show stable trend.
- `sensor_1` vibration deviation reduced below 0.4.
- Auxiliary pump (`sensor_6`) energy consumption reduced.
