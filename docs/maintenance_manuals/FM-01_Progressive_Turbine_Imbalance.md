# Maintenance Manual — FM-01: Progressive Turbine Imbalance

## Safety Precautions
- Ensure turbine is fully shut down and isolated from fuel supply.
- Lockout/tagout procedures applied to electrical and mechanical systems.
- Wear PPE: gloves, eye protection, hearing protection.

## Tools & Equipment
- Vibration analyzer
- Dial indicators / balancing rig
- Torque wrench set
- Inspection borescope
- Workshop hoist (for rotor access)

## Estimated Time
- Inspection and minor balance correction: 2–4 hours
- Rotor removal and balancing: 6–10 hours

## Steps
1. Verify shutdown and lockout/tagout.
2. Record baseline vibration and temperature readings.
3. Use borescope to inspect blade surfaces for erosion or debris.
4. Remove rotor casing and visually inspect blades for asymmetric wear.
5. If imbalance detected, mount rotor on balancing rig and perform corrective mass adjustments.
6. Inspect bearings for wear; replace if scoring or excessive play is observed.
7. Reassemble rotor and run a spin test at low speed while recording vibration signatures.
8. Reset vibration thresholds according to post-maintenance baselines.
9. Monitor for at least 12 hours of normal operation to confirm remediation.

## Verification
- Vibration (low-frequency band) returns to within baseline ±10%.
- `sensor_4` temperature delta returns to baseline.
- No progressive RUL decline observed.

## Notes
- If recurring imbalance persists after balancing, investigate structural alignment of shaft supports and coupling.
