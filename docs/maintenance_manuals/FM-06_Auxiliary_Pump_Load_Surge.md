# Maintenance Manual — FM-06: Auxiliary Pump Load Surge

## Safety Precautions
- Depressurize hydraulic circuits before service.
- Use appropriate PPE for hydraulic fluid handling.

## Tools & Equipment
- Flow meter and pressure gauge
- Visual inspection borescope for hydraulic lines
- Replacement impeller and pump tools

## Estimated Time
- Diagnostic and minor repairs: 1–3 hours
- Pump replacement: 3–5 hours

## Steps
1. Isolate and depressurize hydraulic circuits.
2. Inspect hydraulic lines and filters for blockage; replace filters.
3. Check pump for cavitation signs and inspect impeller for damage.
4. Measure cooling flow rate and verify against specification; clear obstructions if needed.
5. Replace pump impeller or pump assembly if cavitation/damage is confirmed.

## Verification
- `sensor_6` returns to below 0.20 load index during normal operation.
- Cooling flow is within specified range and `sensor_4` shows stable values.
