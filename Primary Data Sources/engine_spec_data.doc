  FM-01: Progressive Turbine Imbalance

Category: Mechanical Degradation
Primary Sensor: sensor_1, sensor_4, sensor_5

Description

This failure mode represents progressive mechanical imbalance in the high-speed turbine shaft. It is typically driven by mass asymmetry, blade erosion, or thermal-induced warping.

Trigger Conditions
sensor_1 < -0.65 g for ≥ 4 consecutive minutes
sensor_4 > 2.5 °C above baseline
RUL decreases faster than 1.5 units/min

Root Causes

Thermal deformation of turbine blades

Debris accumulation in the rotor

Worn or misaligned shaft bearings

Early Indicators

Increased low-frequency vibration signatures

Slight rise in temperature delta (sensor_4)

Mild reduction in efficiency

Operational Impact

5–18% reduction in turbine efficiency

Risk of catastrophic seizure within 10–20 cycles

Recommended Actions

Perform shaft balance inspection

Remove rotor casing and check for asymmetric blade wear

Reset vibration thresholds post-maintenance
